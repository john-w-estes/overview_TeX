As we've mentioned, Arduino projects are often open source. You can find interesting Arduino ideas through 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Arduino Projects Hub
    \item Hackster.io
    \item Instructables.com (just to name a few).
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
Search online for an Arduino project that you find to be interesting. Post a link to it in the Canvas assignment ``Arduino Projects". Explain why you feel this is an interesting project.
