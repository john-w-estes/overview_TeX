\section{Belhaven MCS Academic Experiences}\index{Belhaven MCS Academic Experiences}

In addition to core classes such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Differential Equations, Belhaven's MCS department delivers a number curriculum add-ons. Let's take a look at what additional academic experiences we offer.

\subsection{The Eyes of Faith Portfolio}

\noindent What does the Bible say about mathematics? What does life as a Christian mathematician entail? What role does change and randomness play in God's creation? These are deep questions that we will ask ourselves during throughout our mathematics coursework at Belhaven.

\noindent The book \emph{Mathematics through the Eyes of Faith} by Russell Howell and James Bradley approaches these questions in an intellectually honest manner \cite{eyesoffaith}. Students will use this text as a reference to write their own thoughts in their \textbf{Eyes of Faith Portfolio}, a collaboration of Eyes of Faith papers written over several courses covering chapter of our reference text.

\noindent The chapter breakdown is summarized in the following table. (You might want to hang on to this one.)

\begin{center}

\subsection{Major's Field Test}

Every Belhaven math major takes the standardized Major's Field Test their senior year. The exam is conducted nationally and covers everything from Calculus to Linear Algebra to Algebra and Number Theory. In order to prepare for the MFT Exam, students take MFT Quizzes in key classes and review these quizzes in MAT 492.

\subsection{Mathematical Research}

In MAT 391, 392, 491 and 492, students participate in the mathematical research process reviewing recent results of a select topic and attempting to further it. These students will present their findings as a poster and presentation at the Belhaven University Undergraduate Research Symposium (BUURS).

\subsection{For Engineering Majors}

In addition to academic experiences math majors experience, students in Belhaven's engineering partnership 

\begin{itemize}
    \item learn AutoCAD in PHY 119 Intro to Engineering
    \item interact with professional engineers from places like Yates construction, Raytheon, and Asset Engineering.
    \item take site visits to Ole Miss, Mississippi State, and places like Nissan and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center (ERDC).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Actuarial Sciences}

For those majoring in Actuarial Sciences (ASM), students will

\begin{itemize}
    \item learn statistical software such as R
    \item sit for the first actuarial exam, the Probability Exam (SOA Exam P)
\end{itemize}
