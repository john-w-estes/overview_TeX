\section{HOMEWORK: Pascal`s Triangle}\index{HOMEWROK: Pascal`s Triangle}

Pascal's Triangle is an easy construction that has a variety of interesting patterns and applications. Pascal's Triangle is named after mathematician Blaise Pascal, considered the father of Probability Theory. Pascal used Pascal's Triangle to calculate binomial probability, but the triangle was known and in use other parts of the world centuries before Pascal.
