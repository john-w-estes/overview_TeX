\section{Applications of Calculus}\index{Applications of Calculus}

You probably have heard of calculus, but it's common to not know what calculus is about. Calculus may be the best answer to the question ``When will I ever need math?" In his book ``Infinite Powers", mathematician Steven Strogatz argues that calculus is the greatest human discovery \cite{infinite_powers}. How can that be? Why is calculus deemed to be so important?

\noindent Calculus is the field of mathematics that harnesses the power of infinity. Through it, we can model movement, change, and a huge amount of other important applications in chemistry, biology, computer science, business, physics, engineering, and so much more.

\begin{exercise}\label{calapps}
With a group, search online for places where calculus is used in application or has led to development in some field. Try to find six applications.
\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\
    \item \hspace{1.5in}  \\
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\ 
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\ 
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\ 
    \item \hspace{1.5in}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
While groups are sharing what they discovered, list a few applications that you did have written in Exercise \ref{calapps}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\
    \item \hspace{1.5in}  \\
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\ 
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\ 
    \item \hspace{1.5in} \\ 
    \item \hspace{1.5in}
\end{enumerate}
