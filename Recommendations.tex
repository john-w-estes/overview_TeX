You now know how to get involved with Belhaven MCS's communty and a few of the academic experiences you will participate in. Here are a few more recommendations on how to maximize your time here at Belhaven.

\subsection{Resume}

Go ahead and write a resume. You won't have much to put on a resume yet, but you will as time goes on. Write your resume now, and you update it each semester.

\subsection{Pick a Minor}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Computer Science 
    \item Chemistry
    \item Biblical Studies
    \item Business Administration
    \item Art
    \item Music.
