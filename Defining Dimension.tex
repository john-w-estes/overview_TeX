\section{Defining Dimension}\index{Defining Dimension}

We have already looked at fractals and found some interesting things about them. One of the more interesting fact is that fractals have non-integer dimensions!

\noindent Fractals make us wonder what exactly is dimension.

\subsection{Dimension in Linear Algebra}

Linear Algebra is also very concerned with the notion of dimension. In linear algebra, we visit unfamiliar worlds, and we often wonder how big they are. These ``worlds" are called vector spaces, and the size of these worlds is how we define dimension.

\noindent We typically express the characters in these worlds as matrices. In particular, a $m \times n$-matrix is considered to be a $mn$-dimensional object m (where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns).

\begin{exercise}
Identify the dimension of the following matrices.
\end{exercise}

\[ \left[\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 2 \\
1 & 3
\end{array}\right] \hspace{.4in} \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 5 \\
-1 & 2 & 7
\end{array}\right] \hspace{.4in} \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
5 & 2 & 0 & -6 \\
1 & 0 & 17 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 7 & 0 \\
-1 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & 0 & 2 & 2
\end{array}\right] \hspace{.4in} \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 0 & 8 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]  \]
